# hi there!

I'm a software engineer, currently working in back-end development. I've also
dabbled in full-stack development, cross-platform apps, robotics, digital
signal processing, and digital design.

Beyond coding, I enjoy comedy, hardware hacking, biking, and cooking/eating
rather spicy food. I also have hobbies I do not enjoy, like running.
