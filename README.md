# Hi there!

I'm a software engineer who went to college for computer engineering; I still
love/miss signal processing and digital design. My GitHub activity is
intermittent, so if you were looking to stalk me, check out my
[site](https://www.rajats.site) (which links to all my public accounts) or go
right next door to look at my [gists](https://gist.github.com/rajatscode).

Beyond coding, I enjoy comedy, hardware hacking, biking, and cooking/eating
ridiculously spicy food. I also have hobbies I do not enjoy, like running.
