# hi there!

I'm a software engineer who studied computer engineering (mainly signal
processing and digital design). To look at my internet footprint, check out my
[site](https://www.rajats.site). I also have a few [gists](https://gist.github.com/rajatscode).

Beyond coding, I enjoy comedy, hardware hacking, biking, and cooking/eating
ridiculously spicy food. I also have hobbies I do not enjoy, like running.
